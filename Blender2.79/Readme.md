This sonar simulator is based on Blender 2.79. In Blender 2.79, rectangular-shaped spot light can be generated based on Blender rendered.
However, Blender rendered cannot calculate depth accurately. It seems that the value of depth is not the distance between the object and camera center based on perspective camera model, more likely, it is based on orthographic projection model.
